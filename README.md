Heather's Development Tools Blog
====================

This project uses the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework, which
is "a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and
clean, pragmatic design."

I also used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) since it is so handy for making
a responsive layout.

The tutorial at [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) got me started with this project.

I hope to add more features soon as I learn more about what Django has to offer.
